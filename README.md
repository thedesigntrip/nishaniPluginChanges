1. [x] wp-content\plugins\egrid\includes\widgets\woocommerce\products\assets\js\egrid-products.js
remove scroll animation (ajax done function)
2. [x] wp-content\plugins\egrid\includes\widgets\woocommerce\products\assets\js\category-filter.js
ensure categories are arrays and not string (line 21-23)
3. [x] wp-content\plugins\egrid\includes\widgets\woocommerce\products\templates\filters\categories.php
change multiple to false, and product_cat[] to product_cat

Ideally, I must update this readme file for all the changes that I do in the plugin, but I have a couple more todo tasks, so considering that, all the file changes will be visible in commits
